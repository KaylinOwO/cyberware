# cyberware - csgo movement paste

## important

this is basically an edit of hydraware that I made for a friend a while ago, not gonna go into detail but there really wasn't much interest for me to work on this and after around 6 months of it just sitting there i finally decided it's time to dump the source onto my github.

## cyberware vs. hydraware
a few of the changes in this are
* a total esp overhaul
* added backtrack aswell as extended backtrack/backtrack chams
* various visuals features added
* legit desync (pretty buggy and shitty iirc)
* discord rich presence (won't work out of the box obviously)
